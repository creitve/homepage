# About

Homepage with pretty minimal design which based on [Pixyll's theme](http://pixyll.com) for Jekyll.

## Getting Started

If you're completely new to Jekyll, I recommend to read the documentation at <http://jekyllrb.com>.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/gongled/homepage.git
$ cd homepage
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
```

### Usage

Start the Jekyll Server to run the website.

```
$ jekyll serve --watch
```

You can navigate to `localhost:4000` in your browser to see the site.
