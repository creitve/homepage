Hello! I'm a Linux/UNIX sysadmin. I like the DevOps ideology and absolutely love configuration management systems such as Ansible, Puppet or SaltStack. I like experimenting with new things and especially with a variety of free and open source software. As an performance fanatic I suppose that speed is matters, so I'm obsessed with system optimization and improvement.

On this website I publish scripts and tutorials, mostly for GNU/Linux and other open source software. You can find something interesting for yourself, but keep in mind that mostly this is my own public documentation archive. All the text on this website is free â€” you can use it in any way you want, you can copy it, change it the way you like and republish it. But I would be greatly appreciated if you could keep the link to original article.

All the code on this website is licensed under the MIT license. Just to be clear, the information on this website provided for educational purposes as is and you use it at your own risk. I don't take responsibility if you mess up something.
